Rubik Cube in 5 steps

                 *    *    *
                 *    *    *
                 *    *    *
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
                 *    *    *
                 *    *    *
                 *    *    *

1.  set up cross on point to yellow colour : 
     x    *    x
     *    *     *
     x    *    x

2. float to white pointer side per colour step with two middle layer colour
                     *
                     *
               x    *    x
    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
               *    x    *
                     *
                     *
then white portion keep to down position and yellow is top

3.  complete white layer -  
    find three top layer corner colour where white have to one and which are mathches both side angle. like front and right colour as well as be there.
*remember that - don't choose white corner pics which is on the top layers
   "H"  Algorithem : 
     a. only for FRONT & LEFT
                        U' L' U L
     b. only for FRONT & RIGHT
                        U R U' R'

4.   Top Algorithem for CROSS "+" - 
      continue until create a "+"
                     F (R U R' U') F'
       Conditions :
       i) If match two side as well as Right and Back which  : R U R' U R U2 R'
       ii) If match two side as well as Front and Back :            R U R' U R U2 R'

5. All corner uncorrect pic change and stop when matche both corner side colour with yellow color show :   
                     U R U' L' U R' U' L   

6. Single corner correct pic change and stop when yello come to top : 
                    R' D' R D R' D' R D

Short logic :-
F (R U R' U') F' - top yellow "+"
R U R' U R U2 R' - all side middle match
U R U' L' U R' U' L   - frnt & Bck  / right & bck
R' D' R D R' D' R D - corner setup with top
